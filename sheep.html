    <p>
      Sheep or domestic sheep (Ovis aries) are domesticated, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. 
      Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. 
      An adult female is referred to as a ewe, an intact male as a ram, occasionally a tup, 
      a castrated male as a wether, and a young sheep as a lamb.

    <p>
      The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. 
      It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. 
      The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. 
      Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.

        Chinchillas are either of two species (Chinchilla chinchilla and Chinchilla lanigera) of crepuscular rodents of the parvorder Caviomorpha. 
        They are slightly larger and more robust than ground squirrels, and are native to the Andes mountains in South America. 
        They live in colonies called "herds" at high elevations up to 4,270 m (14,000 ft). 
        Historically, chinchillas lived in an area that included parts of Bolivia, Peru and Chile, but today, colonies in the wild are known only in Chile.
